      Last Updated: February 10, 2022 Thank you for using Stay Seoul! These
      Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and
      Stay Seoul that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and
      other offerings from Stay Seoul (collectively, the “Stay Seoul Platform”).
      When used in these Terms, “Stay Seoul,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the
      Stay Seoul entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting. The
      Stay Seoul Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”)
      to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and
      offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use
      services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”),
      activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of
      travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host
      Service offering, a “Listing”). You must register an account to access and
      use many features of the Stay Seoul Platform, and must keep your account
      information accurate. As the provider of the Stay Seoul Platform, Stay
      Seoul does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host
      Services. Stay Seoul is not a party to the contracts entered into directly
      between Hosts and Guests, nor is Stay Seoul a real estate broker, travel
      agency, or insurer. Stay Seoul is not acting as an agent in any capacity
      for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service
      (“Payment Terms”). We maintain other terms and policies that supplement
      these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and
      use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment
      services provided to Members by the Stay Seoul payment entities
      (collectively "Stay Seoul Payments"). If you are a Host, you are
      responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules,
      regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host
      Services.
